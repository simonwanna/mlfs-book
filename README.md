## What we have done
...


### Grade ‘E’ tasks
- [x] 1. Write a backfill feature pipeline that downloads historical weather data (ideally >1 year of data), loads a csv file with
historical air quality data (downloaded from https://aqicn.org) and registers them as 2 Feature Groups with Hopsworks.
- [x] 2. Schedule a daily feature pipeline notebook that downloads yesterday’s weather data and air quality data, and also the
weather prediction for the next 7-10 days and update the Feature Groups in Hopsworks. Use GH Actions or Modal.
- [x] 3. Write a training pipeline that (1) selects the features for use in a feature view, (2) reads training data with the Feature
View, trains a regression or classifier model to predict air quality (pm25). Register the model with Hopsworks.
- [x] 4. Write a batch inference pipeline that creates a dashboard. The program should download your model from Hopsworks
and plot a dashboard that predicts the air quality for the next 7-10 days for your chosen air quality sensor.
- [x] 5. Monitor the accuracy of your predictions by plotting a hindcast graph showing your predictions vs outcomes
(measured air quality).

### Grade ‘C’ tasks
- [] 6. Update your Model by adding a new feature, lagged air quality for the previous 1 day, 2 days, and 3 days. Measure and
explain the performance improvement or regression for these features.

### Grade ‘A’ tasks
- [] 7. Provide predictions for all air quality sensors in a Swedish city. Select a city by entering your group number here.
